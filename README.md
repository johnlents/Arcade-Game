GAME INSTRUCTIONS:

Point of the game is to score 500 points before losing 3 lives.  100 points are scored each time your player reaches the water without colliding with any bugs.  1 life is subtracted each time your player collides with a bug. You will be alerted if you win or lose the game, and then the game will automatically restart. Have fun!
